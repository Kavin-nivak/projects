        <h1>THE CHARACTERS OF BERSERK</h1><BR>
        <h2 >INTRODUCTION OF BERSERK</h2>
       <img class="center" src="images/b3.jpg" width="700" height="500">
       <p>Berserk is one of the best, if not the best manga of all time. The manga by the late Kentarou Miura has garnered plaudits for its incredible artwork and compelling story throughout the world. The manga has received anime adaptations, but they don't offer the same level of entertainment as the manga itself. It is one of the few unfortunate manga that ended up with a low-quality anime adaptation.
        <br>Updated on March 17th, 2024, by Suzail Ahmad: Berserk is mainly famous for its compelling story that portrays the struggle of a man who tries to swim against the tide. The manga also highlights the various struggles that people face in real life, such as depression, hopelessness, etc. But there is no shortage of action in the story. In fact, there are many powerful characters in Berserk who possess special abilities that give them a distinct advantage over their opponents.
        <br>Many of them gained power by sacrificing someone dear to them, but there was a small minority that worked hard to improve their strength. With the manga entering a brand new arc, it is very likely that fans will get an opportunity to see some of the strongest characters in Berserk.
       </p>
        <h2>GUTS</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/Guts.avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <P>Guts is the main character and protagonist of the Berserk story. His childhood was plagued by one grim event after another, but that didn't stop Guts from becoming one of the strongest characters in the series. Formerly a member of Band of Hawk, Guts was put through more ordeals, which took a toll on him and resulted in him losing his arm.
            <BR>Despite his loss of limb, Guts is still able to swing the Dragonslayer without any problems. He has superhuman strength and stamina, which he has shown time and time again. His strength is further boosted by the Berserker armor, which allowed him to defeat Grunbeld.
        </P>
        <h2>GRIFFITH</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/image.png" width="700" height="500" >
        <P>Griffith's transition from one of the most loved characters to the most hated villain was unthinkable. He was the leader of the Band of Hawk, but his goal was to have his own kingdom. For Griffith, achieving this dream was the most important thing in his life, and he ended up sacrificing his comrades to achieve that.
            <BR>After triggering the eclipse, Griffith was reborn as Femto, one of the members of the God Hand. As Femto, he possesses the ability to manipulate gravity and space. He used the combination of the two to deflect the Skull Knight's slash. Furthermore, his mere presence was enough to send Ganishka into a state of panic.
        </P>
        <h2>CASCA</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/CASCA.jpeg" width="700" height="500" >
        <P>She was a member of the Band of the Hawk with Griffith being her leader. Later on, the band recruited a mercenary named Guts who she resentful towards later falling in love with him.
<BR>
            Upon their rescue of Griffith they were betrayed by him in a blood sacrifice where all the Falcons were slaughtered but her and Guts where Griffith reborn as Femto gives the only survivors a fate worse than death leaving Casca so mentally torn to where her mind is reduced to that of a child and doesn't recover until much later on.
            <BR>
            She is voiced by Yuko Miyamura in the Japanese subs of the 1997 anime, Toa Yukinari in Berserk 2016, the Movie trilogy, and by Carrie Keranen in the English dubs of the 1997 anime, the Movie Trilogy and Karen Strassman in Berserk 2016.</P>
        <h2>SLAN</h2>
        <img class="center" src="imageS/Slan.avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <p>It is extremely difficult to rank the members of the God Hand, as each one of them possesses unique powers. All five members of this circle are represented as fingers of a hand, which has led many readers to assume that all of them are equal.
            <BR>
                One thing is for certain: no apostle can even scratch any member of the God Hand. Together, they're among the most powerful forces in Berserk. It's no wonder they claim the name of divinity.



        </p> 
        <h2>SKULL KNIGHT</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/SKULL.avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <p>The Skull Knight is one of the most cryptic characters in Berserk. He is a sworn enemy of the God Hand and all other monsters. The Skull Knight's swordsmanship is on a completely different level from most characters in the series. He is capable of exterminating hordes of demons with his Sword of Beherits.

            A single slash from the sword is capable of cutting through dimensions, and he was able to trap a multitude of demons within a vortex. In addition to his fighting skills, the Skull Knight is also blessed with incredible foresight, which only adds to his power.</p> 
        <h2>GANSHIKA</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/Ganishka.avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <p>A Kushan Emporer, Ganishka was one of the strongest apostles. Unlike the majority of the apostles, Ganishka detested the God Hand, and wanted to go eclipse them. Ganishka wanted to extend his territory to every corner of the world.

            His power far exceeded that of regular apostles. In his lightning form, he was able to stop Zodd's movements. After being reincarnated, Ganishka mindlessly slaughtered entire armies and destroyed cities without any problems.</p>
         <h2>GRUNBELD</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/Grunbeld.avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <p>Also known as the "Great Flame Dragon," Grunbeld is the leader of the Band of Falcon's giants. He shot to popularity during the Hundred-Year War when he fought against the Tudor invasion with his meager army of 3000 soldiers.
            Grunbeld's physical strength transcends that of most characters in Berserk. Whilst in his apostle form, Grunbeld's strength increases several times over, making him a true nemesis. Furthermore, he also gains the ability to breathe fire. Another testament to his durability is that Guts required the Berserker armor to take him down.
        </p> 
        <h2>ZODD</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/Zodd (1).avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <p>Zodd made a very early appearance in Berserk. He was first revealed in the Golden Age arc, where he slaughtered countless members of the original Band of Hawk. Zodd terrorized battlefields for 300 years, which led to his moniker, "Zodd the Immortal."

            Unlike most apostles, Zodd is highly resilient. Throughout the manga, he managed to survive fights against extraordinary foes, which include the likes of the Skull Knight, Guts, and more.
            
            </p> 
        <h2>SEA GOD</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/Sea-God.avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <p>The Sea God was a gigantic monster that was sealed within an island, but after the Great Roar of the Astral World, it was freed from all sorts of fetters. This led to the consumption of the inhabitants of the island that it was bound to.

            The Sea King was surrounded by numerous tentacles, with each one capable of growing more on its own. It also had several other monsters residing inside it, which attacked any foreign objects. The Sea God's heart was a sonic weapon, which emitted sound waves so powerful that it kept Guts at bay. It was truly a formidable creature.</p> 
        <h2>LOCUS</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/Locus.avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <p>Locus is different from most of the apostles. He is a smart character who thinks before making any decision, and this is a key reason why Griffith is fond of him. His fighting skills are just as strong as his intelligence.

            Locus is considered a legendary fighter whose fighting record is incredible. His weapon of choice is the lance, and he uses it very masterfully. He has not been involved in a serious fight, but it is plausible to assume that he is one of the stronger apostles in the series.</p> 
        <h2>DAIBA</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/Daiba-Berserk.avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <p>Daiba formerly served under the Kushan ruler Ganishka, and he was a close advisor to the emperor. He is an outstanding sorcerer who oversaw Pishacha gana.

            Daiba's incredible knowledge enabled him to create the Beherit, a type of spiritual key that is said to govern the fate of all humanity. Not only that but with his magic, Daiba can summon mythical creatures, which further demonstrates his strength.</p>
         <h2>IRVINE</h2>
        <img class="center" src="images/Irvine (1).avif" width="700" height="500" >
        <p>Irvine is an incredible marksman who holds a high position in the newly formed Band of Hawk. Unlike most of the characters in the series, Irvine does not fight with swords; instead, he uses a bow.
            Irvine's skill with the bow is almost unmatched, and he is capable of hitting multiple enemies in a very short period. His power as an apostle just makes him an even more powerful opponent. In the story of Berserk, Irvine was able to exterminate numerous Kushan generals with very little effort.
